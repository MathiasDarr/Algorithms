"""
Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or
vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

We will make use of a Trie for this problem

Trie Solution:
    1) Add all words to the trie.
    2) Iterate through the board, if the current letter is in the Trie, initiate backtracking
