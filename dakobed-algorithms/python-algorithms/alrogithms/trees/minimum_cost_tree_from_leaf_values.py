"""
Minimum cost tree from leaf values

Given an array of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that
    - Each node has either 0 or 2 children
    - The values of arr correspond to the values of each leaf in an in order traversal
    - The value of each non leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree

Return the smallest possible sum of the values of each non leaf node.
